### Algorithm

The vocabulary monitor contains can use two different algorithms for generating vocabularies. These control which words are used as seed terms for each model:

 - The non-adaptive vocabulary generator uses the same seed terms each time to generate the related terms.
 - The adaptive vocabulary generator uses the related terms generated by one semantic model as seed terms for the next semantic model. This adds an additional possibility: it allows for the semantic models to be used in chronological order, or in reverse chronological order -- searching forwards or backwards in time.
